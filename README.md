# Chess Board Simulator

<!--![Placeholder for App Screenshot](path/to/your/image.png)-->

## Description

A React Native app built with Expo and expo-gl that renders a chess board using OpenGL ES 2.0. This app allows you to visualize a chess board and pieces in a 3D environment, providing an interesting experience for chess enthusiasts.

Yea. It was supposed to be a game but I just run out of time because react-native has stupidly low official openGL support and I was busy with other important stuff.

Consider this as an early demo for a powerful game engine, that I made from scratch for fun.

This project was created as an apprenticeship project that I had about 2 weeks for (I don't remember exactly how much).

## Features

- OpenGL ES 2.0 powered rendering with expo-gl
- NON-Interactive chess board simulation
- React Native and Expo based for cross-platform support. It might work might not. I only have an android to test
- Optimized for mobile performance (That's actually true. Kind of. I went so far as to use instancing, and many optimization technics)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-board-simulator.git
```

2. Navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd chess-board-simulator
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the app:

```bash
npm run start
```

5. Use ExpoGo app on your phone to scan the QR code.
6. Wait for an unbelievable long amount of time
7. See the chess board

## Usage

- Open the app on your device or simulator.
- See the chess board.
- Have fun.
